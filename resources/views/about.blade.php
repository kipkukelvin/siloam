                    <p>The institution is committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment by
                        providing comprehensive Student Support Services (SSS) designed to promote the overall well-being,
                        personal development, and academic success of all students. Our dedicated SSS department offers a
                        range of confidential resources and professional assistance, including individualized counseling for
                        personal, career, and academic matters; mental health support; academic advising and tutoring; and

                        help students navigate challenges, develop essential life skills (such as time management and study
                        habits), and access necessary resources, thereby optimizing their opportunities for personal growth
                        and successful academic progression throughout their time here.</p>
